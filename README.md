# **Capstone Project - building and optimising an ML model within a simulated black-box environment**
## **Overview**
This capstone project forms part of the Imperial College London AI & Machine Learning programme and is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice by applying ML techniques to a realistic optimisation challenge. The project simulates a real-world, black-box environment, where the internal workings of the problem are unknown and information is limited, mirroring the uncertainty often faced by data scientists and ML practitioners in applied settings.

In this challenge, learners are tasked with optimising unknown functions using limited data and feedback. These black-box functions represent real-world applications such as radiation detection, robotic control where evaluations are costly or constrained. The aim is not to find a perfect solution but to demonstrate a sound, evidence-based, and iterative optimisation process. Each week, new data points are queried, model predictions are updated, and strategies are refined
